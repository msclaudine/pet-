    <p><strong>The Savannah </strong>is without doubt one of the extra well-known hybrid breeds,
       the results of a crossing a home cat with an African Serval. Male cats of this breed are sometimes 
      infertile inside the first few generations of the mating however females arenâ€™t.</p>

      <P> If you catch your dog having an accident,<em>say something to get his attention,</em>  
        but do not yell or <em>make such a loud noise that you scare him.</em> </P>
